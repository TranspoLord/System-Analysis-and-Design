# System-Analysis-and-Design

Who is DriverPass and why/what system they want?
DriverPass is a company that provides student drivers with resources and quizzes to help them get their liscences. Students can, also, schedule appointments with drivers to 
practice driving. This company wants a system developed to handle the accounts of the students and the employees, as well as all the material the that system is going to have
for the students. They would, also, like the system to handle the appointment scheduling for the drivers. They do not want to handle security, aside from role based employee
accounts. So, this system will, most likely, be cloud based.

What did I do well?
I think creating what was needed for the system is something that I did well. I created the objects that were needed and filled them with needed information. More vairables and
classes may come when creating the actual system, however, I do believe that I got all the needed classes. Some other classes that would be needed would be quizzes and questions,
and possibly resource texts.

What could I revise?
I think I could revise the Use Case Diagram because I could make the diagram more detailed. After going over it with the class in a discussion and looking at other's, I definitely
could have added more.

How did I interpret the needs and add them into my design?
I combed through the interview transcript that was created for the course work and created a notes sheet. The sheet details everything that might need to be created for the system
Like the roles, student packages, employee objects, and even the scheduling of appointments. I used this sheet many times during the course to make sure I didn't forget anything. 

How do I approach design software? What tips/strategies would I use in the future?
I like how I created my notes at the begining of the course. It helps a lot because, as stated above, it gives a list of things that I might forget, which I can look back on
to remember it. Looking at the list, also, gives ideas what other things the system might need. In my opinion, systems should be modular to allow for easy integration or 
upgrades. In the list, I had made a question mark for leaving the student packages class modifiable, just incase DriverPass would like to modify their own packages later on.
The update would take only changing a few things, but would seem huge to DriverPass.
